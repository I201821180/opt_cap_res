opt_cap_res
====

The package opt_cap_res (optimal capacity reservation) solves the problem of reserving link capacity in a network in such a way that any of a given set of flow scenarios can be supported. It is based on our paper [A Distributed Method for Optimal Capacity Reservation](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/opt_cap_res.html).
